# Potato leaf disease Detection

Introduction

In the agriculture industry, farmers often face challenges in identifying diseases in potato plants, such as early blight, late blight, or determining if the plant is healthy. This uncertainty makes it difficult for farmers to apply the appropriate fertilizers and treatments, impacting crop yield and quality. To address this issue, we have developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify images of potato plants, aiding in the accurate identification of diseases. By leveraging machine learning technology, our solution aims to improve agricultural practices, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately enhance the production of healthy potato plants.

##  Features

1. Image Processing and Analysis: Utilizes image processing techniques to capture and analyze leaf images, identifying visible symptoms like spots, lesions, or discoloration indicative of disease.

2.Machine Learning Classification: Implements machine learning algorithms (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) to classify potato leaf images into healthy or diseased categories based on visual patterns.

3.Real-Time Detection: Capable of real-time disease detection through a mobile app or web-based interface, enabling farmers to diagnose diseases quickly and take preventive action.

4.Disease Identification: Identifies specific diseases (e.g., Late Blight, Early Blight, or Septoria) by recognizing unique symptoms on the leaves, helping in targeted treatment.

5.Accuracy and Efficiency: Designed to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between different stages of disease and providing actionable insights with minimal human intervention.
